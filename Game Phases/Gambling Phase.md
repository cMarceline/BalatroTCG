# Buy In phase
This phase will loop a bit. Use your held chips to grow your own pot. Put your chips directly in front of you as your bet. And there are three actions that will occur
## Step 1: Building Personal Hands
Draw 5 cards out of their [[Personal Deck]], and hold onto two of them, return the other three to the bottom of their [[Personal Deck]]
## Step 2: Draw 1 card for the table
Pull 1 card out of the table's deck. Place them in view of everyone these function as cards that all players are able to usel
## Step 3: Place bets
Each player grows their personal starting pot, hoping to cash out later in a big final pot. Bets are placed clockwise around the table and loops until everyone no longer wishes to grow their pot.
## Repeat with Variation 3 times
On each sequential [[Gambling Phase#Step 1 Building Personal Hands|Step 1]], players draw 1 less card, and only get to hold onto 3 of them

Beware of [[jokers]] that say "when you place a bet," enact their effects accordingly
# Buy Out phase
Beware: Most jokers will be functioning right now! Pay close attention to them and their functions to ensure that you maximise your profits and don't end up stuffing yourself up.
See who has managed to get the best poker hand and rank each player
The player with the strongest hand takes the largest pot by chip size, the player with the second strongest hand takes the second largest pot size, and so on. These are now your final pot
Add chips to your Final Pot and multiply them according to the functions of your [[jokers]], pulling from the Table
While simple in principle, this may take some time to calculate.
