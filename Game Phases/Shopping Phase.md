# Buy In Phase:
From [[The Stock]] reveal 5 [[Shop Cards]], as well as 2 [[Card Packs]], and 1 [[Voucher]]
Each player must place bets to grow their [[Personal Pot]]. Players place their [[Held Chips]] into their pot clockwise, looping until each player is content with their pot. During this buy in phase, bet according to your [[Personal Value]], ie. "I put in 5% of my [[Personal Value]]" or "I put in half of my [[Personal Value]]"
From here players can buy cards from the store by pulling from their [[Personal Pot]]. The player who put the highest percentage of their [[Personal Value]] in their pot gets to buy a card.  [[Purchasing Power]] is determined by whoever has the most of their [[Personal Value]] their [[Personal Pot]].
By putting chips from their [[Personal Pot]] onto the card, they will claim the card for themselves, and the chips they put onto it now determines that [[Card Value|Cards Value]]. After each purchase, reassess who has the highest percentage of their [[Personal Value]] in their [[Personal Pot]].
# Buy Out Phase:
At this point players may bargain with each other, and sell cards they are holding onto. There are two types of sale, the [[Clean Sale]] and the [[Dirty/Forced Sale]]
### Clean Sales
Players agree on a value greater than the current [[Card Value]], the player buying the card must have enough [[Held Chips]] to give the selling player the agreed value, as well as grow the [[Card Value|Card's Value]] equivalent to the agreed value.
### Dirty/Forced Sales
If a player doesn't want to sell a card, but another player really wants it, they can forcibly buy it. To force purchase, find the percentage that the desired card is contributing to a player's [[Personal Value]] (up to 33%). Then the purchasing party can put that percentage of their own [[Personal Value]] onto the card, as well as handing that percentage to the store, and claim it for themselves.
	NOTE: If a card is contributing more than 33% to a player's [[Personal Value]] then it can be force bought for only 33% of the purchaser's [[Personal Value]]
